# Gottfrids Donuts-webbshop

As a part of an assignment during my front end education we created a one page webshop that sells donuts, with focus on JavaScript. Here we have more or less the full function of buying a donut with different discounts. 

*Few selected aspects:*
1. On Mondays before 10 am: 10% discount.
2. On Fridays after 3 pm until Monday 3 am: an additional 15% price increase on each donut.
3. Purchasing at least 10 of the same dounut: 10% discount.
4. Free shipping when purchasing at least 15 donuts (otherwise 25 kr + 10% of total order sum.).
5. The payment method "invoice" is not selectable when purchasing for 800 kr or more.
